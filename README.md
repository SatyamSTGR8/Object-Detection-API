# Object-Detection-API
Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. This repository implements Yolov3 using TensorFlow 2.0. 
This is Object-Recoginition-API and the below video shows its implementation where the code successfully detects Apple,Person,Banana,Clock,Handbag . The code is trained to detect many more things like Train,Dog,Car,Ball,Cup etc.
